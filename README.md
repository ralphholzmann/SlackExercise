##Summary
A simple application skeleton for Flask based web apps.

##Usage
Make any changes to the app in the appropriate place. Then run ./start.sh to start a debug server on port 500. The server is accessible at http://localhost:5000. I would highly recommend installing virtualenv first and running start.sh in a virtual environment.
